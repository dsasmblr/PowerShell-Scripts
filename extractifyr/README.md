# extractifyr
This script is a work in progress. Currently, it allows the user to specify a file that is zip-compressed, a folder to extract the files to, and then it extracts the files. The file extension of the user's selected file doesn't matter so long as the first two bytes of its magic number start with 0x50 0x4B (PK).

**Instructions:**

1. *Select a file to extract.*
2. *Select a directory to extract to.*
3. *Do it again if you want.* =)

There will be a lot more coming for this script, in which this space will be updated accordingly!
