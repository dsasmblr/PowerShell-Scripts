# extractifyr
*This script is a work in progress.*

**extractifyr** is a PowerShell script that will identify all zip files within a directory (as well as all child directories therein) and present the option to extract those files. Alternately, the user can specify a file to extract. Even if the file isn't named .zip, if it's a zip-compressed archive, it will be found! This is very useful for quickly dumping zip-compressed resources from video game directories, etc.

**Instructions:**

1. *Select a file to extract or a folder to scan.*
2. *Select a directory to extract the file(s) to.*
3. *Do it again if you want.* =)

There will be a lot more coming for this script, in which this space will be updated accordingly!
